This folder contains the files used to compile the source code into usable html, js, and css files.

Before compiling, you must have tsc from Typescript in order to compile correctly.  Be sure to install npm from Node.JS and run `npm install -g typescript` to install Typescript

After you have Typescript run compile.bat to compile it in Windows, compile.sh to compile it in Linux.

To run the project, simply open the index.html in the bin folder that should be created after the compilation process with the browser of your choice.
